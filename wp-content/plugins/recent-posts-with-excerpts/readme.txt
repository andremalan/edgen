A widget that lists your most recent posts with optional excerpts.   

== Description ==

A widget that lists your most recent posts with excerpts, optionally limited to a category. The number of posts and excerpts is configurable; for example, you could show the titles of five posts but include the excerpt for only the two most recent. Supports <a href="http://robsnotebook.com/the-excerpt-reloaded/">the_excerpt Reloaded</a> and <a href="http://sparepencil.com/code/advanced-excerpt/">Advanced Excerpt</a> for excerpts with HTML formatting.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` 
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Go to Appearance &rarr; Widgets to add widgets to your sidebar in widget-ready themes.

Tip: to style your excerpts, add a declaration for `.recent_with_excerpt li blockquote` to your theme's stylesheet.
