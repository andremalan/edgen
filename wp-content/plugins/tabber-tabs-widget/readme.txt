== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It makes it very easy for users to add a cool tabbed area in their sidebar.

= I don't like the look, can I change it? =

Tabber Tabs comes with two tabs styles built in.  Just choose which one you want from the dropdown in the Tabber Tabs widget.

= I tried the default styles and still don't like the look, can I change it? =

Absolutely!  If you know CSS then you can change the entire look of your tabbed area; colors, tab style, anything.

= I just designed the coolest custom tabs! Do you want to include them with the plugin? =

That would be great.  If you designed some really cool tabs, with some custom CSS, and you would like us to include it as a "style", <a href="http://www.slipfire.com/contact">then please contact us.</a>
