Avatar allows you to create / edit custom avatars for your users right in the Admin Panel. Uses the same directory structure as BuddyPress,
so your avatars will be sideways-compatible if you have BuddyPress installed. Most of the code in here is inspired-by or a 
direct copy of the BuddyPress /change-avatar/ code

== Description ==
