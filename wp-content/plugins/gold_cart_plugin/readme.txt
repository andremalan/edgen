If you are moving your Gold Cart to another site and are going to activate it with the same key you must first deactivate it from your old site.
To do this go to Store >> Upgrades ensure your Gold Cart is currently active and 'click reset API Key' you can now Install / Activate Gold Cart on your new site.

==== Upgrading Gold Cart from WP e-commerce 3.6 series to 3.7+ series ====

1. Remove ALL 'gold_cart_files' files from the ï/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/upgrades/Í directory, This must be done first as it causes conflicts with the new files.
